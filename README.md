# FOKON 

Fokon is a discord bot created in python during the 2025 discord buildathon with a view to help developpers, science amateurs, gamers and all type of people interested in computers and general science in their daily tasks or to learn more and train their skills.

The bot supports slash commands with a bunch of categories of commands that we'll explore later on this page.

## CONTRIBUTION

First of all , thanks for considering this part of the README , contributions are more than welcome!
Where to contribute?
There is 3 main zones on this repo that could need ameliorations:
-The code itself , if you have better ways to proceed a command
-The issues , if issues are declared for the repo i would love to see your solutions
-Verification of information, as you can see  the json files contains knowledge (periodic table + quizzes) **THESE ARE MOSTLY GENERATED BY AI** so if you see any errors in the informations do not hesitate to fork the repo and modify the wrong parts.

### Credits

Thanks to the community of [Discord developpers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) for supporting the project and providing good ideas and inspirations.
