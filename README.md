# FOKON 

Fokon is a discord bot created in python during the 2025 discord buildathon with a view to help developpers, science amateurs, gamers and all type of people interested in computers and general science in their daily tasks or to learn more and train their skills.

The bot supports slash commands with a bunch of categories of commands that we'll explore later on this page.

⚠️THE PROJECT IS IN DEV, MANY FEATURES AREN'T COMPLETED . IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE SCROLL TO CONTRIBUTE CATEGORY DOWN THE PAGE ⚠️




## PREVIEW

## COMMANDS

### General purpose

**/quizz {category}**

Current available categories:

- software
- hardware
- electronics
- cybersecurity
- blockchain
- 3dmodeling
- webdevelopment
- networking

**/periodic {element}**
element argument can be :
-symbol
-element name
-atomic number

**/nohello**

**/resistance {voltage} {current}**
Returns the resistance needed for a given voltage and current.

**/resistance_color {number_of_lines}  {color1} {color2}  {color3}  {color4}  {color5}**
Translate a resistor color code with the value of the resistance

**/random {minimum} {maximum}**

**/github {repo}**
repo argument needs to be in this format ``username/repositoryname``

## TECH & STACK

Here is the [Discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/api.html#discord.ext.commands.Context)



## CONTRIBUTION

First of all , thanks for considering this part of the README , contributions are more than welcome!
Where to contribute?
There is 3 main zones on this repo that could need ameliorations:
-The code itself , if you have better ways to proceed a command
-The issues , if issues are declared for the repo i would love to see your solutions
-Verification of information, as you can see  the json files contains knowledge (periodic table + quizzes) **THESE ARE MOSTLY GENERATED BY AI** so if you see any errors in the informations do not hesitate to fork the repo and modify the wrong parts.

### Credits

Thanks to the community of [Discord developpers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) for supporting the project and providing good ideas and inspirations.

The code to display github repository informations is inspired by Rachelle Palmer from her [Post](https://dev.to/techbelle/how-to-retrieve-github-repository-data-using-python-59g3) on dev.io



## TO-DO 

GENERAL 



~~/random {x} {y}  #Generates a random number between x and y ~~

~~/github {repository_link} #Get the informations of a repository~~

~~/quizz #Get a random developper question to answer~~

~~/nohello #Sends the nohello.net link~~

/sleep_calculator {wake_up} {wanted_cycle(default:190min)}  # returns the next best sleep hours

--ELECTRONICS--

~~/Resistance {voltage} {Current}~~

~~/resistance_code n{color}   with n number of arguments , you input the color of the resistance in ~~
~~the correct order and the bot will help you knowing the resistance value~~

--SCIENCE--

~~/periodic {element} # we take element.lower and get from a dictionnary or small db the information of the element~~
